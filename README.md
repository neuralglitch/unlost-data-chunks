## Unlost Data Chunks
A recovery log for strange encrypted data fragments found at forgotten locations.

### Late 2024: Mysterious email
I received a bizarre email from an unknown sender using the address `delta47sigint@maildrop.cc`.

The subject was:  
`Hidden Data – Archive. Hint for Access in the Future`

The message contained no files - just three sets of GPS coordinates and cryptic phrases:
```
The lost data waits.  
It shall be discovered at the places that hold the forgotten.

29.08640264421758, -13.450426084408708 – Where the past gathers in empty spaces.
35.00784770355935, 25.82743841070011 – Beneath the rocks, where the wind whispers.
52.07428901141415, 4.306197246073584 – Concealed in shadows behind the right sign.

All the drives are pieces of the puzzle, but there are more...  
You will find them, if you seek.
```

Out of curiosity, I checked the locations. Strangely enough, I realized I had already planned trips to all of them -
Lanzarote in March, Crete in May, and The Hague in early June.

### March 2025: Abandoned houses near Charco del Palo, Lanzarote
During the first trip, I visited the coordinates on Lanzarote. In an abandoned structure near the coast, I found a USB
stick-unlabeled, dusty, and definitely not something left by accident.

The only marking: **`EXTN_REG/NULL`**.

I created this repository to document the recovery process and store anything that might be extractable.  
The filesystem is encrypted. No access yet. No idea what’s on it.

When I tried to mount the stick, I was met with a dead end:  
`Fatal Error: Encrypted filesystem – Unable to mount without decryption module`

### May 2025: Bunker near Koutsounari Beach, Crete
Second fragment retrieved from the interior of a decaying World War II-era bunker, hidden along the island’s southern 
coast. The structure was open, exposed, and long abandoned - concrete walls, sand-covered floor, no visible markings.  
The SD card was found lodged inside a narrow crack near the base of the rear wall, partially concealed by debris.  

No label. No visible origin.  

The filesystem is fragmented. Same signature, different error. Still no access yet. And still no clue what’s inside.

When both the USB stick and the SD card are mounted simultaneously, a cryptic error message is triggered - suggesting 
that a third component is required to initiate full decryption:
`0xF1Ω32: Secondary cipher vessel missing - Mount cryptographic adjunct to initialize key-synthesis`

### Current status
- **Devices recovered:** March 2025 (Lanzarote), May 2025 (Crete)
- **Filesystem:** Partial match – joint mounting triggers error
- **Decryption:** Blocked – third component required
- **Next step:** Visit The Hague coordinates (June)

Coincidence seems less likely with each discovery. Two fragments aligned - and the trail isn’t cold yet.
