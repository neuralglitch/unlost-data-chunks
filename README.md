# Unlost Data Chunks
## A strange message. A forgotten place. A found device.

### Mysterious email

In late 2024, I received a bizarre email from an unknown sender.

The subject was:  
`Hidden Data – Archive. Hint for Access in the Future`

The message contained no files — just three sets of GPS coordinates and cryptic phrases:
```
The lost data waits.  
It shall be discovered at the places that hold the forgotten.

29.08640264421758, -13.450426084408708 – Where the past gathers in empty spaces.
35.00784770355935, 25.82743841070011 – Beneath the rocks, where the wind whispers.
52.07428901141415, 4.306197246073584 – Concealed in shadows behind the right sign.

All the drives are pieces of the puzzle, but there are more...  
You will find them, if you seek.
```

Out of curiosity, I checked the locations. Strangely enough, I realized I had already planned trips to all of them —
Lanzarote in March, Crete in May, and The Hague in early June.

### Abandoned houses near Charco del Palo, Lanzarote
During the first trip, I visited the coordinates on Lanzarote. In an abandoned structure near the coast, I found a USB
stick—unlabeled, dusty, and definitely not something left by accident.

The only marking: **`EXTN_REG/NULL`**.

I created this repository to document the recovery process and store anything that might be extractable.  
The filesystem is encrypted. No access yet. No idea what’s on it.

When I tried to mount the stick, I was met with a dead end:  
`Fatal Error: Encrypted filesystem – Unable to mount without decryption module`

### Current status
- **Device recovered:** March 2025 (Lanzarote)
- **Filesystem:** Encrypted – requires unknown decryption module
- **Next steps:** Visit Crete and The Hague coordinates (May & June)

Whether it’s coincidence or something else — I intend to follow this through.
